Butler's idea is to help the user keeping up with house bills and keep
track of how much he spend every month. It's also intented to allow checking price evolution over time.

It's also its intension to help provide functionality to manage tenants information if the user has rented houses.

Also, it will be possible to manage tenants if the user has any in a given rented house.
This part of the application will allow features like the following:
Having houses with tenants, the user becomes a landlord.

Ideas:
- Landlord
 - Manage houses (name, location, max number of tenants, images)
 - Possibity to comunicate with proper APIS to post new ads when landlord is looking for new tenants
 - Manage tenants (names, dates of entry and exit)
 - Invite tenants so that he can check his account
 - Add new bills (and allow image upload for the bill receipt)
 - Calculate amout to pay to each tenant for each bill and ability to sum that all up
 - Email tenants with amount to pay (detailed information as well)
 - Given a bill, calculare price for tenants
 - View bill history, for each of the bills, or as a whole

- Tenant
 - Manage Bills
 - Menage personal information
